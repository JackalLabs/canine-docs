The Jackal Proof-of-Persistence (JPOP) works through a series of contracts formed between the storage provider and the user. These contracts contain the Merkle Tree root hash of the file and the information required to prove ownership of the file. Storage Providers are responsible for posting Merkle Proofs within a challenge window determined by the blockchain. These challenge windows require the provider to post the raw chunk of data corresponding to the index of the challenge window alongside the required Merkle Hashes to prove the data belongs to the Merkle Root stored on the contract. These challenge indexes are chosen at random by the blockchain using a block-hash-based random number generator paired with a random data oracle.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/encryption":{"id":"protocol/encryption","title":"Encryption","description":"Jackal has two main features that rely on encryption techniques to keep user data private and secure. The two main models are file encryption and file-entry encryption. These reside in different locations within the protocol. The files themselves are stored on Storage Providers, which require files to be encrypted before they are transferred to those machines. The file entries are data structures living directly on-chain in the File Tree blockchain module, again needing to be encrypted on the client\'s device before being sent to the blockchain. The file encryption model is simply performed by taking the file as raw bytes and randomly generating a key in the user\'s client. This key is called a Symmetric Key. We then pass both the key and the file through AES256 encryption, which results in an encrypted file that can safely be sent to the Storage-Providers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/dsig":{"id":"protocol/modules/dsig","title":"dsig Module","description":"dsig","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/filetree":{"id":"protocol/modules/filetree","title":"filetree Module","description":"Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/jklmint":{"id":"protocol/modules/jklmint","title":"jklmint Module","description":"jklmint","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/lp":{"id":"protocol/modules/lp","title":"lp Module","description":"lp","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/module-overview":{"id":"protocol/modules/module-overview","title":"Module Overview","description":"Protocol Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/rns":{"id":"protocol/modules/rns","title":"rns Module","description":"rns","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/storage":{"id":"protocol/modules/storage","title":"storage Module","description":"storage","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/modules/wasm":{"id":"protocol/modules/wasm","title":"wasm Module","description":"wasm","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"protocol/storage-providers":{"id":"protocol/storage-providers","title":"Storage Providers","description":"A Jackal Storage Provider is a dedicated web server optimized for data storage that accepts incoming files from users and creates contracts for the users to approve.
