# What is the JKL Token?

The JKL Token is the native token that powers the infrastructure of the Jackal Protocol and can be applied in a multitude of different ways. 

## dApps

Applications built on the Jackal Protocol, such as Jackal Storage and the RNS Marketplace may choose to leverage the JKL token to expand its utility. 


## Securing the Network

As the Jackal Protocol is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Cosmos L1 blockchain, JKL can be delegated to validators to secure the network and earn JKL rewards. Otherwise known as staking or staked tokens.

## Transaction Fees
Transactions on the Jackal Protocol must be paid for using JKL. As the protocol is PoS, cost of transactions are inexpensive. 

## Governance
Staked tokens grant on-chain governance participation within the Jackal Protocol to vote on text, software, spend, and other governance proposals. 

## Collateral
The JKL token can act as collateral for validators, storage providers, and other smart contract usecases. 

## Liquidity Provision
JKL can be allocated into a liquidity pool to earn JKL rewards.
