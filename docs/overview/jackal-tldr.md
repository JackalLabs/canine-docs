# What is the Jackal Protocol?

The Jackal Protocol is a fast, scalable, and secure blockchain that empowers individuals, developers, and enterprises to increase their data privacy and cybersecurity posture without sacrificing ease of use. This protocol strives to offer world-class applications to protect the planet’s most important data–your data. 

Unlike other blockchains, the Jackal Protocol utilizes both validators and storage providers. The Jackal Protocol allows developers to build decentralized applications with the ability to interface with all Jackal Protocol Modules–including storage contracts and file structure. This allows developers to adjust the ownership of data, share data with other jackal users or smart contracts, and transfer small or large amounts of encrypted data without centralized storage providers or middleware. This data is always self-custodial meaning no one– not even the team at Jackal–can access or view your data. 

This blockchain currently consists of seven [modules](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/README.md): [jklMint](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/jklmint/README.md), [lp](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/lp/README.md), [rns](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/rns/README.md), [wasm](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/wasm/README.md), [storage](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/storage/README.md), __filetree__ and [dsig](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/dsig/README.md). These interoperable modules allow for the creation of secure, scalable, and truly decentralized applications.
