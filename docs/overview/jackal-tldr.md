# Discover the Jackal Protocol

The Jackal Protocol provides a decentralized infrastructure for secure and scalable data storage, enabling individuals, developers, and enterprises to protect their data privacy and improve their cybersecurity posture. It offers a platform for building decentralized applications, managing access control and ownership, transferring encrypted data, and maintaining self-custodial control over data, all without relying on centralized storage providers or intermediaries.

Jackal Protocol stands apart, utilizing both validators and storage providers, enabling developers to create decentralized applications with seamless access to all [Jackal Protocol Modules](/docs/protocol/modules/module-overview.md), including storage contracts and file structures. Customize data ownership, share data with other Jackal users or smart contracts, and transfer encrypted data of any size, all without centralized storage providers or middleware. Your data remains self-custodial, ensuring that no one—not even the Jackal team—can access or view it.

Comprising seven interoperable [modules](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/README.md) — [jklMint](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/jklmint/README.md), [lp](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/lp/README.md), [rns](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/rns/README.md), [wasm](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/wasm/README.md), [storage](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/storage/README.md), [filetree](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/filetree/README.md), and [dsig](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/dsig/README.md) — the Jackal Protocol allows for the development of secure, scalable, and truly decentralized applications .

The Jackal Protocol is [open source](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain) and community-driven, fostering a transparent and trustless ecosystem. Dive into this wiki to access comprehensive information on the protocol, usage, infrastructure, and opportunities.

Maintained by the dedicated [Jackal Labs](/docs/official-links/jackal-labs) and [Jackal Foundation](/docs/contributors/foundation.md) teams, the Jackal Wiki is constantly updated to ensure accuracy. Should you discover anything out-of-date, don't hesitate to reach out, as we strive to keep our documentation impeccable for the community.
