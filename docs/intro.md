# Getting Started

Youâ€™ve arrived at the Jackal Wiki! Thank you for taking the first steps towards a more secure, simple, and self-custodial digital experience.

The Jackal Protocol is [open source](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain) and community-driven to facilitate a transparent and trustless system. This wiki is a one-stop shop with information on the protocol, usage, infrastructure, and opportunities.

The Jackal Wiki is maintained by Jackal Labs and the Jackal Foundation teams. We work tirelessly to maintain our documentation, but if you happen to stumble upon something out-of-date, please reach out to our teams so we can keep our documentation accurate in perpetuity.
