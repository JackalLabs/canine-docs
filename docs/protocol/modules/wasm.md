# WASM Module

The `wasm` module in the Jackal Protocol incorporates the CosmWasm smart contracting platform, which is designed
specifically for the Cosmos Ecosystem. This module provides a secure and efficient environment for executing
WebAssembly (WASM) smart contracts on the Jackal Protocol.

## Overview

The `wasm` module manages the following aspects of the CosmWasm platform:

1. **Smart Contract Deployment**: Allows developers to deploy smart contracts written in Rust or other languages that
   compile to WASM.
2. **Smart Contract Execution**: Facilitates the execution of smart contract functions on the blockchain.
3. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Enables users and other smart contracts to interact with deployed smart contracts.

For a more detailed guide on integrating the wasm module into your application, please refer to
the [Jackal Protocol GitHub](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/README.md).
