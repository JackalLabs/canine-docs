# wasm Module

## wasm
Jackal incorporates the CosmWasm smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos Ecosystem. The primary programing language used in this module is Rust for building secure and multichain smart contracts, yet any language that can be compiled into WASM can be supported as they become available.
