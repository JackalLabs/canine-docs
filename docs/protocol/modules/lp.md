# LP Module (Coming Soon)

The `lp` (Liquidity Provision) module is a vital part of the Jackal Protocol, enabling the creation and management of liquidity pools for trading and swapping tokens. This module provides a decentralized solution for users to contribute liquidity to the ecosystem and earn rewards in return.

## Overview

The `lp` module manages the following aspects of liquidity pools:

1. **Liquidity Pool Creation**: Allows the creation of new liquidity pools for token pairs.
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Facilitates users to add or remove liquidity from existing pools.
3. **Token Swaps**: Enables decentralized trading and swapping of tokens within the liquidity pools.
4. **Rewards**: Distributes rewards to liquidity providers proportionate to their contribution.

For a more detailed guide on the 'lp' module, please refer to the [module documentation](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/lp/README.md) on GitHub.
