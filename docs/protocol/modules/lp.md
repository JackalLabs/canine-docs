# lp Module




## lp
The lp module allows for a native automated market maker (AMM) liquidity pools (LP) to be built directly into the Jackal Blockchain. This allows for local prices for payment mechanisms without the need for oracles, along with the ability to swap tokens directly from the Jackal dashboard or the Jackal Swap service.
