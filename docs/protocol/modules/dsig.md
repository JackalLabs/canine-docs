# dsig Module

## dsig

The dsig module is a digital signature service that allows users to collect signatures from multiple users who are registered on the Jackal Blockchain. Users can create 'forms' associated with a unique file stored on Jackal and can add signees (users) to collect their signatures. The signees have the following options to respond: Approve, Deny, Abstain, and No Response (Default). The form can execute a custom function after all users have voted to Approve the form.
