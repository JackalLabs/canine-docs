# Name Service Module

The `rns` (Reverse Name Service) module is an essential component of the Jackal Protocol, providing a user-friendly naming system for blockchain addresses. The RNS module simplifies the process of interacting with complex addresses by mapping them to human-readable names. This module allows users to transfer tokens and permissions to files/folders stored on the Jackal Protocol using human readable names. 

## Overview

The `rns` module manages the following aspects of the Reverse Name Service:

1. **Name Registration**: Allows users to register unique names for their blockchain addresses.
2. **Name Management**: Facilitates updating, renewing, and transferring RNS names.
3. **Name Resolution**: Provides a mechanism for resolving RNS names to their corresponding addresses.
4. **Name Sales**: Enables users to buy and sell RNS names through the RNS Marketplace.
5. **Name Transfers**: Enables users to transfer RNS names.

For a more detailed guide on integrating the rns module into your application, please refer to the [module documentation](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/x/README.md) on GitHub.
