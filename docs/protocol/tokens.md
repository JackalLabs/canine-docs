# Tokens
## JKL or Jackal 
JKL is an inflationary token that powers the Jackal Protocol. The JKL Token has many use cases. Some of these use cases are below. 

- __dApps__ - Applications built leveraging the Jackal Protocol, such as Jackal Storage and the RNS Marketplace, may choose to include the JKL token to expand its utility. 

- __Securing the Network__ - As the Jackal Protocol is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Cosmos L1 blockchain, JKL can be delegated to validators to secure the network and earn JKL rewards. Otherwise known as staking or bonded tokens.

- __Transaction Fees__ - Transactions on the Jackal Protocol must be paid for using JKL. As the protocol is PoS, the cost of transactions is inexpensive. 

- __Governance__ - Staked tokens grant on-chain governance participation within the Jackal Protocol to vote on text, software, spend, and other governance proposals. 

- __Collateral__ - The JKL token can act as collateral for validators, storage providers, and other smart contract use cases. 

- __Liquidity Provision__ - JKL can be allocated into a liquidity pool to earn rewards. 

## JWL or Jewel

JWL is an L1 store-of-value token native to the Canine Blockchain. JWL tokens are immutable, meaning they can never be created, changed or destroyed. There is a finite amount of JWL that will be minted at the chain's genesis. Currently, there is no utility for the JWL token and it should be treated as such.
