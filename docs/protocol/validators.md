# Validators
The Jackal Validators are web servers that are secure, dedicated machines that participate in the consensus protocol by broadcasting cryptographic signatures, or votes, to agree upon the next block. Voting power is determined by the amount of staking tokens delegated by non-validators and bonded as collateral to earn a reward. These non-validators, or delegators, incur the risk of getting punished (slashed) if the delegate validator gets hacked or violates the protocol.
